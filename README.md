# Skin Cancer Classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

## Overview
This project focuses on classifying skin cancer using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). It aims to leverage deep learning techniques to accurately classify images of skin lesions as benign or malignant.

## Objectives
- To develop a CNN model capable of accurately classifying skin cancer images.
- To evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics.
- To provide a user-friendly interface for uploading images and receiving predictions.

## Dataset Description
The dataset consists of labeled images of skin lesions categorized into benign and malignant classes. Each image is preprocessed to fit the input requirements of the CNN model.

## Model Information
The model architecture includes multiple convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers optimized for image classification tasks. Performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall are used to evaluate the model.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- TensorFlow/Keras
- OpenCV for image preprocessing
